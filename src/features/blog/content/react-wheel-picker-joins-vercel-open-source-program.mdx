I'm thrilled to share that [React Wheel Picker](https://react-wheel-picker.chanhdai.com) has been selected to join the [Vercel Open Source Program: Summer cohort](https://vercel.com/blog/summer-2025-oss-program#react-wheel-picker)!

React Wheel Picker is a lightweight, customizable, and touch-friendly picker component for React — built to deliver a smooth, native-like scrolling experience across modern browsers. It started as a side project, and it's been amazing to see it grow with the help of open source contributors and feedback from users.

Being part of Vercel OSS Program means the project will receive $300/month in infrastructure credits for the next 12 months, along with support from the developer community. I'm incredibly grateful for Vercel's support — it's a big motivation to keep improving the project and pushing it forward.

If you're curious, feel free to explore the demo or dive into the code:
